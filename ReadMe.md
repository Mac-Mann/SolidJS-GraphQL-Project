New project to play around with SolidJS and Vite, As well as stuff like GraphQL, etc.

If you haven't ever heard of SolidJS, see this [100 second video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hw3Bx5vxKl0) for why it's better than React.

To run open two terminal windows. 

Cd first into the root folder and run nvm use. To align your node version.

Then cd into the server folder and run npx ts-node index.ts
Then cd into the client folder in your other window and run yarn dev ðŸš€

Future things to add: 
1. Docker support
2. Database (most likely MongoDB)
3. More advanced stuff with SolidJS
